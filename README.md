### List of things todo
in the order I think I should do them
- "Lose" condition
- Make code actually function good (first real rust project ever)
- Make code actually look good
- Logging
- Dynamic ratelimits
- Better concurrency
  - Keep track of message IDs so buttons correspond to games
- Use actual Tetris SRS
- "Next Up" display
- "Hold" functionality
- Scoring
- See if there are any other Tetris guidelines I need to follow
